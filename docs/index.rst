:code:`pyngrok` is a Python wrapper for `ngrok <https://ngrok.com/>`_ that manages its own binary and puts
it on our path, making :code:`ngrok` readily available from anywhere on the command line and via a
convenient Python API.

Installation
------------

:code:`pyngrok` is available on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/pyngrok/>`_ and can be installed
using :code:`pip`.

.. code-block:: sh

   pip install pyngrok

That's it! :code:`pyngrok` is now available `as a package to our Python projects <#open-a-tunnel>`_,
and :code:`ngrok` is now available `from the command line <#command-line-usage>`_.

Open a Tunnel
-------------

To open a tunnel, use the :code:`connect()` method, which returns the public URL generated by :code:`ngrok`.

.. code-block:: python

   from pyngrok import ngrok

   # Open a tunnel on the default port 80
   public_url = ngrok.connect()

The :code:`connect()` method takes an optional :code:`options` parameter, which allows us to pass additional
options that are `supported by ngrok <https://ngrok.com/docs#tunnel-definitions>`_.

## get active tunnels

It can be useful to ask the :code:`ngrok` client what tunnels are currently open. This can be
accomplished with the :code:`get_tunnels()` method, which returns a list of :code:`NgrokTunnel` objects.

.. code-block:: python

   from pyngrok import ngrok

   tunnels = ngrok.get_tunnels()
   # A public ngrok URL that tunnels to port 80 (ex. http://<public_sub>.ngrok.io)
   public_url = tunnels[0].public_url

Close a Tunnel
--------------

All open tunnels will automatically be closed when the Python process terminates, but we can
also close them manually.

.. code-block:: python

   from pyngrok import ngrok

   public_url = "http://<public_sub>.ngrok.io"

   ngrok.disconnect(public_url)

The :code:`ngrok` Process
-------------------------

Opening a tunnel will start the :code:`ngrok` process. This process will remain alive, and the tunnels
open, until :code:`ngrok.kill()` is invoked, or until the Python process terminates.

If we are building a short-lived app, for instance a CLI, we may want to block on the :code:`ngrok`
process so tunnels stay open until the user intervenes. We can do that by accessing the :code:`NgrokProcess`.

.. code-block:: python

   from pyngrok import ngrok

   ngrok_process = ngrok.get_ngrok_process()
   # Block until CTRL-C or some other terminating event
   ngrok_process.process.wait()

The :code:`NgrokProcess` also contains an :code:`api_url` variable, usually initialized to
:code:`http://127.0.0.1:4040`, from which we can access the `ngrok client API <https://ngrok.com/docs#client-api>`_.

If some feature we need is not available in this package, the client API is accessible to us via the
:code:`api_request()` method. Additionally, the :code:`NgrokTunnel` objects expose a :code:`uri` variable, which
contains the relative path used to manipulate that resource against the client API. This package also gives us
access to :code:`ngrok` from the command line, `as shown below <#command-line-usage>`_.

Configuration
-------------

Setting the :code:`authtoken`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Running :code:`ngrok` with an auth token enables additional features available on our account (for
instance, the ability to open more tunnels concurrently). We can obtain our auth token from
the `ngrok dashboard <https://dashboard.ngrok.com>`_ and install it like this:

.. code-block:: python

   from pyngrok import ngrok

   ngrok.set_auth_token("<NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN>")

   # Once an auth token is set, we are able to open multiple tunnels at the same time
   ngrok.connect()
   ngrok.connect(8000)

This will set the auth token in the config file. We can also set it in a one-off fashion by
setting it for `the "auth" key <https://ngrok.com/docs#tunnel-definitions>`_ of the `options` parameter
passed to :code:`connect()`.

Config File
~~~~~~~~~~~

The default `ngrok config file <https://ngrok.com/docs#config>`_ lives in the home
directory's :code:`.ngrok2` folder. We can change this in one of two ways. Either pass the
:code:`config_path` parameter to methods:

.. code-block:: python

   from pyngrok import ngrok

   CONFIG_PATH = "/opt/ngrok/config.yml"

   ngrok.connect(config_path=CONFIG_PATH)

or override the :code:`DEFAULT_CONFIG_PATH` variable:

.. code-block:: python

   from pyngrok import ngrok

   ngrok.DEFAULT_CONFIG_PATH = "/opt/ngrok/config.yml"

   ngrok.set_auth_token("<NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN>")

Binary Path
~~~~~~~~~~~

The :code:`pyngrok` package manages its own :code:`ngrok` binary. However, we can use our :code:`ngrok` binary if we
want in one of two ways.  Either pass the :code:`ngrok_path` parameter to methods:

.. code-block:: python

   from pyngrok import ngrok

   NGROK_PATH = "/usr/local/bin/ngrok"

   ngrok.get_tunnels(ngrok_path=NGROK_PATH)

or override the :code:`DEFAULT_NGROK_PATH` variable:

.. code-block:: python

   from pyngrok import ngrok

   ngrok.DEFAULT_NGROK_PATH = "/usr/local/bin/ngrok"

   ngrok.connect()

Command Line Usage
------------------

This package also puts the default :code:`ngrok` binary on our path, so all features of :code:`ngrok` are also
available on the command line.

.. code-block:: sh

   ngrok http 80

For details on how to fully leverage `ngrok` from the command line, see `ngrok's official documentation <https://ngrok.com/docs>`_.

API Documentation
-----------------

For more advanced usage, have a look at the :doc:`API documentation for pyngrok <api>` to understand the
public interfaces available to developers.
